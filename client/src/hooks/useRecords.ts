// AI suggestion: 
// useRecords.ts: If youâ€™re not doing any data fetching from the frontend yet, you can skip this for now. You can instead use simple mock data or a static list until the backend is more developed.
// Once you have the backend working with the API, you can then create the useRecords hook that fetches data via GET and adds records via POST.
